# Sora-ai-code-retriever

Hello! I built this tool because I was bored and wanted to experiment.

## What it does

This project uses the `https://escaping.work/soraforall/` API to generate many user IDs and retrieve Sora codes.

## Recommendation

To reduce the chance of hitting rate limits, I recommend using **100+ user IDs**.
